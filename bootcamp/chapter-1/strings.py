# Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names.
# Strings in Python are actually a sequence, which basically means Python keeps track 
# of every element in the string as a sequence. 
# For example, Python understands the string "hello' to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. 
# This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters 
# (like the first letter, or the last letter).


s1 = 'hello'
s2 = "This is a sample string"

print('This is another sample string')
print('it"s an example to show how to use a quote in a quote')
